This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.6.

## Motivation

The Pomodoro technique is a time management method used by countless people. Its main purpose is to divide time spent working into more achievable chunks. Working on something for too long often leads to burnout, and a pomodoro timer is an excellent way to avoid that. Our website is meant to be an easy to use study tool with additional components to manage tasks, jot down ideas, and even enter deadlines. 

## Backend

This application uses Google's Firebase service for three main purposes. The first is hosting the live version of the website which allows our webapp to exist on more than a development server. Along with this we use firebase to authenticate and store data for each individual user. Users each have their own task list entries, journal entries, event entries, and timer settings.
